# hanselman.com bugs
A place for you to file issues/bugs that you've found on Scott Hanselman's blog at http://hanselman.com

## What is this?

I have a blog at https://hanselman.com/blog that I've run for almost 20 years.0 

Recently it moved from being: 

* a 13 year old .NET Framework app on ASP.NET and a Windows Server on real metal hardware 

to

* a fresh and new .NET Core app forked and improved by Mark Downie https://github.com/poppastring/dasblog-core and running under Linux on Azure!

If you find any issues like

* Broken links and 404s where you wouldn't expect them
* Broken images, zero byte images, giant images
* General oddness

Please file them here if they are specific to hanselman.com/blog

Thanks friends!
